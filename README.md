# MachineLearningProject
A simple machine learning model that is designed to detect cancer in three different types of histopathological images: lung benign tissue, lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma. Created as an inspiration point for a future in biomedical engineering and using AI and machine learning to improve healthcare for both patients and doctors.
