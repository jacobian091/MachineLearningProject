# MachineLearningProject
A simple machine learning model that is designed to detect cancer in three different types of histopathological images: lung benign tissue, lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous cell carcinoma. Created as an inspiration point for a future in biomedical engineering and using AI and machine learning to improve healthcare for both patients and doctors.

# ModelDeployment
With the help of ChatGPT, I was able to make my machine learning model come to life. I used an open-source framework called StreamLit that allowed me to make an "app" on a local browser where I can directly test example images into the model. I now have a functioning model that is both accurate and easy to use. Video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcr-v1nC5_0
